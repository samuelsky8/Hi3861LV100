 *
 * \brief   This file contains Diffie-Hellman-Merkle (DHM) key exchange
 *          definitions and functions.
 *
 * Diffie-Hellman-Merkle (DHM) key exchange is defined in
 * <em>RFC-2631: Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Method</em> and
 * <em>Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #3: Diffie
 * Hellman Key Agreement Standard</em>.
 *
 * <em>RFC-3526: More Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman groups for
 * Internet Key Exchange (IKE)</em> defines a number of standardized
 * Diffie-Hellman groups for IKE.
 *
 * <em>RFC-5114: Additional Diffie-Hellman Groups for Use with IETF
 * Standards</em> defines a number of standardized Diffie-Hellman
 * groups that can be used.
 *
 * \warning  The security of the DHM key exchange relies on the proper choice
 *           of prime modulus - optimally, it should be a safe prime. The usage
 *           of non-safe primes both decreases the difficulty of the underlying
 *           discrete logarithm problem and can lead to small subgroup attacks
 *           leaking private exponent bits when invalid public keys are used
 *           and not detected. This is especially relevant if the same DHM
 *           parameters are reused for multiple key exchanges as in static DHM,
 *           while the criticality of small-subgroup attacks is lower for
 *           ephemeral DHM.
 *
 * \warning  For performance reasons, the code does neither perform primality
 *           nor safe primality tests, nor the expensive checks for invalid
 *           subgroups. Moreover, even if these were performed, non-standardized
 *           primes cannot be trusted because of the possibility of backdoors
 *           that can't be effectively checked for.
 *
 * \warning  Diffie-Hellman-Merkle is therefore a security risk when not using
 *           standardized primes generated using a trustworthy ("nothing up
 *           my sleeve") method, such as the RFC 3526 / 7919 primes. In the TLS
 *           protocol, DH parameters need to be negotiated, so using the default
 *           primes systematically is not always an option. If possible, use
 *           Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), which has better performance,
 *           and for which the TLS protocol mandates the use of standard
 *           parameters.
